# Lottery generator

The task is to implement a lottery generator which is in the 

    hu.test.lottery.LotteryGenerator

class. 

The generateNumbers methods' body should be implemented which returns a collection of integers for lottery. Other classes/interfaces should not be updated added.

The method has 3 parameters:

- count - the number of elements in the 
- from - the lower boundary of the possible numbers
- to - the upper boundary of the possible numbers

Deciding the best return type - which is marked as question mark - is also part of the excercise.

The RandomImpl#nextInt method which is already implemented should be used for the random generation.

Upon completion please file a pull request from a fork with the solution.
